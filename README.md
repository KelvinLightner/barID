# barID
The mobile application that allows you to create and checkout out of bar tabs using invisible pay.
__________________________________________

Welcome to the launch of barID the IOS and Android mobile app that is seeking to transform bar tabbing into one of seamless user experience. 

Could you imagine walking into a bar. Opening an application. Ordering. Picking up your drink. And then walking out?

There is no longer a need to imagine such things because the technology is Here!

WE are integrating iBeacons into our mobile application to allow for the convenience of opening a tab and closing one without waiting in any lines.

iBeacon is a newer technology that uses Bluetooth-like-sensors to deliver context and micro-location to phones and other smart devices. 
By placing ibeacons in any of the physical world, businesses are able to trigger contextual actions on our phones based on proximity.
Thus far in our prototype we have officially enabled location proximity. There is still some slight work that needs to be done with event triggering.

Before you today is the full mobile application that is accessible and downloadable to any iOS or android device. 

APPLICATION FEATURES:
There are 2 types of user profiles: A Person and Business

If I were to login as a user I will be brought to the users tab at the bar they are currently at. 
User App Functionality
1. Login
2. Add drink to tab
3. Edit said drink
4. Cancel drink

Now moving on to the bar - by logging in to an account that has been setup with admin privileges

Admin App Functionality - Tablet | iPad
1. See the drinks ordered at your bar
2. Message the person when the drink is ready 
3. Remove the drink from your queue

Our next step is to Use IBeacon - so that by simply knowing if you have walked out of the range of the bar - we will be able to automatically close your tab and charge your account. 

Thereby allowing for a seamless ordering experience.

Be on the lookout for barID at an App Store near you.
